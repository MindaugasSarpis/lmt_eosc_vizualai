Part of a broader workspace (`lmt_eosc/`) that includes `lt_infra_graph` (infrastructure knowledge graph) and `combined_snapshots` (EOSC framework documentation).

## Data Resources

## Sibling Project Reference

`../lt_infra_graph` — A related project using Cosma/D3.js for interactive knowledge graph visualization with a Node.js build pipeline. May serve as a pattern for tooling choices in this project.
